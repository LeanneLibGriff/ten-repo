 Step 10
# Digital Object Identifiers (DOI) and Persistent Identifiers (PiD)  

At the end of your project, make your research data findable, accessible and re-useable using a Persistant Identifier (PiD) such as a DOI.

### Identifiers vs Persistant Identifiers

##### Identifiers

Examples: Serial numbers, URLs. 

An identifier is any label used to name an item uniquely (whether digital or physical).  URLs are an example of an identifier. So are serial numbers and personal names

Management NOT guaranteed:

* links disappear
* websites shut down
* product support ends

##### Persistant Identifiers
Examples: [ORCID](https://orcid.org/), [Digital Object Identifier](https://www.doi.org/)

Management guaranteed:

* links kept up to date over a defined time period.
* links will find the object, even when websites change over time.


##### A Digital Object Identifier (DOI) is a unique alphanumeric string that is:

* assigned by either a publisher, organisation or agency 
* identifiing content
* providing a **persistent** link to its location or record on the internet
* facilitate citation and citation metrics 

A DOI might look something like this: [http://dx.doi.org/10.4225/01/4F8E15A1B4D89](http://dx.doi.org/10.4225/01/4F8E15A1B4D89)

**OR**

Like this: [https://research-repository.griffith.edu.au/handle/10072/394379](https://research-repository.griffith.edu.au/handle/10072/394379)

The second example of a DOI or *Persistent Identifier* is from [Griffiths' Research Data Repository](https://research-repository.griffith.edu.au/).

#### DOIs uniquely identify research data and support citation and citation metrics.

### Key messages:
* DOIs are a persistent identifier and as such carry expectations of curation, persistent access and rich metadata
* DOIs can be created for DATA SETS and associated outputs (eg grey literature, workflows, algorithms, software etc) - DOIs for data are equivalent with DOIs for other scholarly publications
* DOIs enable accurate data citation and bibliometrics (both metrics and altmetrics)
* Resolvable DOIs provide easy online access to research data for discovery, attribution and reuse

### Beginner
Ensure data you associate with a publication has a DOI. Library staff are the best people to talk to about how to do this.

### Intermediate
* Learn more about how your DOI can potentially increase your citation rates. 
* Read the [ANDS Data Citation Guide](https://www.ands.org.au/guides/data-citation-awareness).

### Advanced
* Learn more about [PiDs and DOIs](https://www.ands.org.au/guides/persistent-identifiers-awarenes)

### Internal Resources
* Contact the Library Technology Services Team at [digitalrepository@griffith.edu.au](digitalrepository@griffith.edu.au) for advice on how to obtain a DOI upon project completion.
